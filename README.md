Objective
---------

This project is a variation of the [Mau-Mau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mau-Mau_(card_game)) card game using colors instead of suits and descriptive names instead of card faces.

This is meant to be a configurable version of the game, with some rules being configurable by the host.

The game can be played directly in the browser at [https://kasama.github.io/p2p-uno](https://kasama.github.io/p2p-uno).

It doesn't need a server (Apart from a [TURN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT) server provided by [PeerJS](https://peerjs.com/)), so the game's network code is based on trust, which means it's very easy to cheat if you want to. Circumventing that is a non-goal.
